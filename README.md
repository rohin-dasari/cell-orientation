# cell-orientation
Describe the orientation of cells growing on a patterned gel surface by using a principle component analysis.
Provided below is a raw microscopy image and the same image after it has been fed through the algorithm. It can be seen that the algorithm does a decent job at allowing for a visualization of the orientation of the cells through a quantitatively sound technique.
